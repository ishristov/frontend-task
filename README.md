# Adeva Take Home Task

## Getting Started

* Run `yarn && yarn start` to install all dependencies and start the application.
* Go to [home](http://localhost:8081) to get started.

## What we are building

The app we are building is a note taking dashboard with the following features:

* The dashboard should have a sidebar with all notes listed, clicking on a note should reveal the content.
* I should be able to add, edit and delete a note.
* I should be able to search for notes.
* I should be able to see the content of the note.

## What we are looking for

* All functionality should be working as expected.
* Readability.
* Maintainability.
* Testability.

PS: *You can use localStorage to persist your data and try as much as possible not to use any css framework*
